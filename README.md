# InfantMRISegmentation
In this project, I try to reproduce the result of this paper [LINKS: Learning-based multi-source IntegratioN frameworK for Segmentation of infant brain images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914010349).

The basic metholody of this paper is to use Random Forest to classify the four part of infant brain MR image(WM, GM, CSF, BG).
